It’s been two months since I’ve been meditating every single day. This wonderful state of mind encouraged me to spread the meditation techniques to all the people arround me. As I always struggle with my anxiety and suttle changes of mental state since I was a child, I never thought meditation could help me the way it has. As an academical-intelectual-scientist-with-no-religion, I always looked at meditation a little bit skeptical and thought of it as dellusions people would do to confuse themselves and run away of their problems. The intensity of being a person who loves drinking, smoking and hard parties made me think that the _zen_ atmosphere would make me lose this feeling of well-being that I loved so much.

However, last year some friends encouraged me and I decided to give it a try. After the first week, the results were very impressive, and it caught my attention by breaking this solid armor I had within me. I never thought I could have a peaceful moment with myself, or while facing a stressful situation. My mind worked by itself, and it really hurted me.

I am a begginer in the meditation practice, so I thought it would be motivating for people to know that the _zazen_ practice does not require a deep knowledge or a fully-deep-concentration to be started. It just requires your own desire.

## 1. You have to accept : It works. It REALLY works.

In order to achieve the positive results meditation can provide us, anxious people, you have to deactivate — even if it is just for a couple of minutes — your skeptical swift. Allow your mind and spirit to go along this experience. If even after you tried for a week, you realize that this didn’t change absolutely anything in your routine, self-esteem and perception, then you’re allowed to give up. But just after these previous steps.

## 2. Don’t face meditation as pain-killers.

When you sit in your meditation posture, don’t expect it to solve or relief all your problems and struggles. It has not analgesic properties, it is rather a way of separating yourself from the avalanche of feelings and thoughts that consume us on a daily basis. A beloved friend and zen student used to say to me: _“You are not your mind, it is just a part of you”_. I think this sentence really helps ourselves to mantain control and understand our existence in a lighter perspective.

## 3. Start slowly and steadily

Even if your mind set allows you to [just stay a minute](http://www.onemomentmeditation.com/) or two meditading, let it go. The most important things about meditation are the routine and discipline. After setting yourself a routine  —  I strongly suggest that you start it first thing in the morning  —  then you can work yourself out to increase your meditation time. But at this time, focus on estabilishing a disciplined routine.

## 4. Don’t be hard on yourself

Ok, ok. It is surely not easy for us to sit and do nothing for a minute. We are always connected or forcing ourselves to keep thinking about our worries, bills to pay, rlationships, work problems, wars, facebook, whatsapp messages. So, take it easy if you miss a day or two. Practice the self-compassion will help you during this process.

## 5. Don’t try to “think about nothing” ou “just don’t think”

These are classical mistakes people make when thinking about meditation. The techniques used in the zazen (commom budhist word to refer to the meditation process) are focused to free your mind, body and self-control from your deepest emotional and sharpest thoughts. There are thoughts that could be very harmful to your self-esteem, your productivity and your relationship with people that surround you. Meditation improves your abilities to _deal_ with these thoughts and making them disappear is not the goal here. The skill of handling it with your own thoughts and mind are the goal we are searching for when we meditate.

## 6. Don’t panic

It’s not easy for us, post-modern creatures, to stop our daily activities to just sit and pay attention on our breath, body and put ourselves in the position of observer-wolves. It is difficult, and requires energy. Don’t stress yourself if it is hard to concentrate or even if your legs hurt. The pain on the legs is mentioned by Zen Masters frequently. If the psysichal sensations are being a problem, [try using a chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO6erMHHS0).

## 7. Results come along within the process, not as goals

As Shunryiu Suzuki affirms on his extraordinary book “[Zen Mind, Begginer’s Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-Shunryu-Suzuki/dp/1590308492)”, the meditation practice must be itself a part of your everyday life, a part of you, and not the goal itself. If we think about having a peaceful mind and being a total-zen person as results, this might stress ourselves, intefering in our development. The results are not so clear. Your will feel the changes in little moments of your routine, not as extraordinary epiphanies. It is not a magical revelation or a substancial move in your life. It’s simply a better way of dealing with our thoughts and perceptions.

## 8. Don’t try to change your behavior.

You don’t have to stop eating meat or quit smoking to let the zen way of life take part in your routine. It’s true that, once engaged in _zazen_ practice, you will face some momentum and the willing to change everything. But the practice comes before the changes. What _zazen_ provides is a more clear state of mind, in which you are able to accept your wills and fondest identity inside yourself.

## 9. Let technology help you.

Nowadays basically there are apps for everything. Meditaton apps provide guided meditation, a count of days and hours you meditate and also a huge variety of packages, that can be used to improve your health, perfomance, self-esteem and others. By indication of a friend, I am currently using [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), the first 10 days are free, and then you have a to pay a US$12 fee, but it is really worthy. This Independent’s [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/the-10-best-meditation-apps-8947570.html) brings another nice choices for you.

So, Good Luck and I hope you really take part on this practice!
